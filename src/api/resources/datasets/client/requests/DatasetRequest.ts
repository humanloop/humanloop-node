Click on \"Organization Settings.\"\n If you do not see this option, you might need to contact your organization admin to gain the necessary permissions.\n\n3. Within the settings or organization settings, select the option labeled \"API Keys\" on the left. Here you will be able to view and manage your API keys.\n\n4. You will see a list of existing API keys. You can perform various actions, such as:\n     - **Generate New API Key:** Click on the \"Generate New Key\" button if you need a new API key.\n     - **Revoke an API Key:** If you need to disable an existing key, find the key in the list and click the \"Revoke\" or \"Delete\" button.\n     - **Copy an API Key:** If you need to use an existing key, you can copy it to your clipboard by clicking the \"Copy\" button next to the key.\n\n5. **Save and Secure API Keys:** Make sure to securely store any new or existing API keys you are using. Treat them like passwords and do not share them publicly.\n\nIf you encounter any issues or need further assistance, it might be helpful to engage with an engineer or your IT department to ensure you have the necessary permissions and support.\n\nWould you need help with anything else?"
